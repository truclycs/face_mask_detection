    Do nms on single class.
    Hint: For the specific class, given the bbox and its confidence
    1) Sort the bbox according to the confidence from top to down, we call this a set.
    2) Select the bbox with the highest confidence, remove it from set, and do IOU calculate with the rest bbox.
    3) Remove the bbox whose IoU is higher than the iou_thresh from the set.
    4) Loop step 2 and 3, until the set is empty.
